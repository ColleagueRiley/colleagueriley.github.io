    <p> 
        Hello, I'm Riley an C programmer who's been programming for over 6 years. I specialize in software programming, mainly with low-level tech.
        <br/> <br/>
        I'm passionate about creating lightweight libraries and tools that make development smoother and more performant, especially in areas like graphics, input, and platform abstraction. My work focuses on cross-platform compatibility, performance, and simplicity.
        <br/> <br/>
        I maintain several open-source projects, including RGFW (a lightweight window/input/context abstraction library), RSGL (a modular graphics toolkit), and Minigamepad (a minimal cross-platform game controller library).
        <br/> <br/>
        Whether it's building from the ground up or contributing to open ecosystems, Iâ€™m always excited to learn, improve, and develop quality software.
